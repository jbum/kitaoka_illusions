These are reconstructions based on images published by Professor Kitaoka in his books and on his website. The goal is to eventually reconstruct most of the full-page illustrations from the 2002 book "Trick Eyes" as well as a number of notable images from Kitaoka's website.

All of these images are programmed in the Python dialect of Processing.
